# Adobe Photoshop API - Firefly Services

Unlock the potential of Adobe Photoshop and cutting edge AI/ML services through an easy-to-use RESTful API.

## Overview

Welcome to the Adobe Photoshop API, now integrated into Firefly Services. Our API follows REST-like principles, utilizing standard HTTP response codes, verbs, and authentication methods that return JSON-encoded responses. While the examples provided are in cURL, feel free to develop your application in any preferred language.

This guide will assist you in:

- Creating a project within the Adobe Developer Console
- Obtaining and authenticating your credentials
