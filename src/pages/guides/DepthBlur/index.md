# DepthBlur

The DepthBlur API supports applying depth blur to your image. Depth Blur is part of the Neural Filters gallery in Photoshop. It allows you to target the area and range of blur in photos, creating wide-aperture depth of field blur effects. You may choose different focal points or remove the focal point and control the depth blur through manipulating the focal range slider. Setting focusSubject to true will select the most prominent subject in the image and apply depth blur around that subject.
