# Using Photoshop API guides

The code snippets and example implementations throughout these guides are using one of our [sample psd](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/cis-photoshop-api-docs/blob/main/sample_files/Example.psd) files. Feel free to download and use it for testing.

You'll need to have this file stored in accepted external storage. For more information on storage please refer to the [File Storage](../../getting_started/storage_solutions/index.md).

## Before you start

For each of these examples to run. You first have to get your Bearer token and API key. You'll find these in the [Getting Started](../../getting_started/index.md) section.

For ease of use, you can export your token and API key before running the examples.

```shell
export token="<YOUR_TOKEN>"
```

```shell
export apiKey="<YOUR_API_KEY>"
```
