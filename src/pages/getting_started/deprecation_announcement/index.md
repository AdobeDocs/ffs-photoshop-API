# Deprecation Announcement

The Remove Background V1 API is being deprecated in favor of the Remove Background V2 API.

The Remove Background V1 API will reach End of Life (EOL) on *October 15, 2025*. After this date, V1 will no longer be supported or accessible.
Please begin migration to Remove Background V2 as soon as possible to ensure uninterrupted service.

For guidance about this change, refer to the FAQs below.

<AccordionItem header="Why Is Adobe Making This Change?" isChevronIcon position="right" iconColor="#1473E6">

We're moving to the Remove Background V2 API because it delivers:

* *Cleaner cutouts* - The improved post-processing reduces matting and creates sharper edges.

* *Higher quality automation* - Outputs with V2 are optimized for production pipelines and automated workflows.

* *Ongoing support* - V2 is the actively supported service that will receive updates and improvements.
