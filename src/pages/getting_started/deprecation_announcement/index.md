# Deprecation Announcement

The Remove Background V1 API will reach End of Life (EOL) on October 15, 2025. After this date, V1 will no longer be supported or accessible.
Please begin migration to Remove Background V2 as soon as possible to ensure uninterrupted service.

For guidance, refer to the FAQs below.

## What Should I Do?

Migrate to the Remove Background V2 API before October 15, 2025, to avoid service disruptions.

## Why Is Adobe Making This Change?

We're moving to the Remove Background V2 API because it delivers:

* Cleaner cutouts - improved post-processing reduces matting and creates sharper edges.

* Higher quality automation - outputs are optimized for production pipelines and automated workflows.

* Ongoing support - V2 is the actively supported service, ensuring updates and improvements going forward.
