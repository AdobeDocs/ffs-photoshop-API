<AccordionItem header="Why Is Adobe Making This Change?" isChevronIcon position="right" iconColor="#1473E6">

We're moving to the Remove Background V2 API because it delivers:

* *Cleaner cutouts* - The improved post-processing reduces matting and creates sharper edges.

* *Higher quality automation* - Outputs with V2 are optimized for production pipelines and automated workflows.

* *Ongoing support* - V2 is the actively supported service that will receive updates and improvements.
